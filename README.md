#Laplace's Equation Solver

This is a javascript implementation of application of the relaxation method for solving Laplace's equation in a rectangular region. A similar tool has been developed in the past, but this is built using modern frameworks, and this outputs, along with the traditional color-coded 2D graph, a 3D graph that users can freely rotate and observe.

This is intended solely as an educational tool.

In more practical situations, one would use a tool based on the [finite element method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_element_method).

A big part of this tool is the 3D rendering of the solved region, and it is based on [pre3d](https://github.com/deanm/pre3d) framework developed by Dean McNamee. It is old but solid. His 3D graphic calculator, [GraphyCalc](http://www.graphycalc.com) was the main inspiration and help for the 3D render part.
